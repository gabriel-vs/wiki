# CS50

CS50 (Computer Science 50) is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University and Yale University. In 2016, CS50 became available to high school students as an AP course.

The course material is available online for free on EdX with a range of certificates available for a fee. The on-campus version is Harvard's largest class with 800 students, 102 staff and up to 2,200 participants in their regular hackathons.

After a participant has completed CS50, there are several follow on programs including CS50 Computer Science for Web Programming, CS50 Computer science for Artificial Intelligence, CS50 Computer Science for Game Development and CS50 Computer Science and Mobile Apps (archived). These programs are all available on the EdX platform.
